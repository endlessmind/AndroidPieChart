AndroidPieChart
===============

This is a simple PieChart for Android.
I don't know exactly how far back you can use it,
but i know it runs fine as far back as Andrid 2.2.

This PieChart has selection mode.
A PiePiece can be select via code or by touch.

Feel free to use!
If you have any improvment, please don't be shy :)
